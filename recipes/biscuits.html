            <li>2 cups of flour (250g)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>
                6 tablespoons of vegan butter (frozen or chilled in the freezer
                for at least 30 min)
            </li>
            <li>3/4 cup of whole milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 475F. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment
                paper. Grab your biscuit cutting tool of choice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Using a cheese grater, grate in the cold butter.</li>
            <li>
                Mix together with a wooden spoon until the texture is crumblike.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the milk and mix together until the dough can mostly form a
                ball.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put mixture on floured surface and, without overworking, flatten
                to about 1 inch and fold onto itself. Repeat 5-6 times.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flatten a final time to 1 inch and cut out six biscuits,
                recombining if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes until golden brown on top.</li>
            <li>Eat!</li>
        </ol>
