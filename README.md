# odin-recipes
This is the recipes project from the Odin Project. It showcases my ability to perform many basic HTML functions and use tools in a way that matches general best-practices.

Some cool skills that are showcased are ordered and unordered lists, anchor elements with relative and absolute links, images with alt text, and bold/italicized text.

There's much more to come in the future!
